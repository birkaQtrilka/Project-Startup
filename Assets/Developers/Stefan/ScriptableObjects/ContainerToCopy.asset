    <Description>k__BackingField: "Factfulness: The stress-reducing habit of only
      carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.\r\n\r\nWhen asked
      simple questions about global trends\u2015what percentage of the world\u2019s
      population live in poverty; why the world\u2019s population is increasing;
      how many girls finish school\u2015we systematically get the answers wrong.
      So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess
      teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers.\r\n\r\nIn Factfulness,
      Professor of International Health and global TED phenomenon Hans Rosling, together
      with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation
      of why this happens. They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective\u2015from
      our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us
      and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive
      progress (believing that most things are getting worse).\r\n\r\nOur problem
      is that we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and even our guesses are
      informed by unconscious and predictable biases.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the
      world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think.
      That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t real concerns. But when we worry about
      everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we
      can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.\r\n\r\nInspiring
      and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, Factfulness
      is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world
      and empower you to respond to the crises and opportunities of the future."

    <Description>k__BackingField: "Every time Allie Brosh posts something new on
      her hugely popular blog Hyperbole and a Half the internet rejoices.\r\n\r\nTouching,
      absurd, and darkly comic, Allie Brosh\u2019s highly anticipated book Hyperbole
      and a Half showcases her unique voice, leaping wit, and her ability to capture
      complex emotions with deceptively simple illustrations.\r\n\r\nThis full-color,
      beautifully illustrated edition features more than fifty percent new content,
      with ten never-before-seen essays and one wholly revised and expanded piece
      as well as classics from the website like, \u201CThe God of Cake,\u201D \u201CDogs
      Don\u2019t Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving,\u201D and her astonishing,
      \u201CAdventures in Depression,\u201D and \u201CDepression Part Two,\u201D
      which have been hailed as some of the most insightful meditations on the disease
      ever written.\r\n\r\nBrosh\u2019s debut marks the launch of a major new American
      humorist who will surely make even the biggest scrooge or snob laugh. We dare
      you not to.\r\n\r\nFROM THE AUTHOR:\r\nThis is a book I wrote. Because I wrote
      it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is.
      I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the
      book is and also sound vaguely authoritative\u2014like maybe someone who isn\u2019t
      me wrote it\u2014but I soon discovered that I\u2019m not sneaky enough to pull
      it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in
      the book:\r\n\r\nPictures\r\nWords\r\nStories about things that happened to
      me\r\nStories about things that happened to other people because of me\r\nEight
      billion dollars*\r\nStories about dogs\r\nThe secret to eternal happiness*\r\n\r\n*These
      are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!"

    <Description>k__BackingField: "A.A. Milne's Pooh stories need no introduction;
      they have been loved by generations of children and their parents ever since
      they were first published in 1926.\r\n\r\nIn his autobiography, Milne wrote:
      'The animals in the stories came for the most part from the nursery. My collaborator
      [his wife] had already given them individual voices, their owner by constant
      affection had given them the twist in their features which denotes character,
      and Shepard drew them, as one might say, from the living model.'\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nContains:\r\n\r\n
