    <Description>k__BackingField: When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley
      in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and
      fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she
      was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at
      point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her
      to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary
      journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United
      Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful
      protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. This is the
      remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for
      girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged
      his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce
      love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons. This story will make
      you believe in the power of one person's voice to inspire change in the world.

    <Description>k__BackingField: The birth of Jesus has been well chronicled, as
      have his glorious teachings, acts, and divine sacrifice after his thirtieth
      birthday. But no one knows about the early life of the Son of God, the missing
      years -- except Biff, the Messiah's best bud, who has been resurrected to tell
      the story in the divinely hilarious yet heartfelt work "reminiscent of Vonnegut
      and Douglas Adams" (Philadelphia Inquirer).Verily, the story Biff has to tell
      is a miraculous one, filled with remarkable journeys, magic, healings, kung
      fu, corpse reanimations, demons, and hot babes. Even the considerable wiles
      and devotion of the Savior's pal may not be enough to divert Joshua  from his
      tragic destiny. But there's no one who loves Josh more -- except maybe "Maggie,"
      Mary of Magdala -- and Biff isn't about to let his extraordinary pal suffer
      and ascend without a fight.

    <Description>k__BackingField: "No man would get close to her again! \r\n\r\nThe
      scars of an adolescent indiscretion were still so raw that Liza kept her heart
      uninvolved in any relationships. A modeling career and business had given her
      material success and peace of mind. \r\n\r\nThen she collided with G. K. Gifford
      outside her Essex cottage and poof - there went her hard-won serenity. For
      this wealthy man had crashed into her life to break up his nephew's friendship
      with a \"gold digger\" and the chemistry between them had flared."
