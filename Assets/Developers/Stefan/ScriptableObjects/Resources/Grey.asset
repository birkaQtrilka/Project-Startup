  <Description>k__BackingField: Christian Grey exercises control in all things; his
    world is neat, disciplined, and utterly empty ... until the day that Anastasia
    Steele falls into his office, in a tangle of shapely limbs and tumbling brown
    hair. He tries to forget her, but instead is swept up in a storm of emotion he
    cannot comprehend and cannot resist. Unlike any woman he has known before, shy,
    unworldly Ana seems to see right through him ... past the business prodigy and
    the penthouse lifestyle to Christian's cold, wounded heart.
