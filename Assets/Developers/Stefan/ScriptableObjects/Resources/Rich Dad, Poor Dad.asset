  <Description>k__BackingField: "April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the
    personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal
    Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor
    Dad was first published, readers will find that very little in the book itself
    has changed \u2014 and for good reason. While so much in our world is changing
    a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad
    haven\u2019t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in our daily
    lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s international bestseller are more
    timely and more important than ever.\r\n\r\nMilestones \r\n\r\nWhile there is
    a milestone  to commemorate \u2014 and a new section in the book on Why Milestones
    Are Important \u2014 preserving the integrity of the original content is testimony
    to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars throughout
    the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have been updated
    again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents \u2014 those who
    embraced Robert\u2019s story and messages 25 years ago \u2014 are sharing them
    with new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense
    lessons can be applied to anyone\u2019s life and their vision for a future that
    includes taking control of their finances.\r\nPeople of all cultures and countries
    celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time, mark progress, reflect on
    the lessons we\u2019ve learned, and celebrate accomplishments\u2026 and they
    give meaning to our life\u2019s journey. They are a way that we integrate past,
    present, and future\u2026 looking back at where we started, where we are today\u2026
    and the promise of all that the future can hold."
