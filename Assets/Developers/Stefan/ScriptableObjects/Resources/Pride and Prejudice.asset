  <Description>k__BackingField: 'Pride and Prejudice is an 1813 novel of manners
    written by Jane Austen. The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth
    Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions
    of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial
    goodness and actual goodness.



    Mr. Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate
    in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only
    be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces
    becoming very poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of
    the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives
    the plot.'
