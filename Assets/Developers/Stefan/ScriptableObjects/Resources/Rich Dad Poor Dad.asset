  <Description>k__BackingField: "It's been nearly 25 years since Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s
    Rich Dad Poor Dad first made waves in the Personal Finance arena.\r\nIt has since
    become the **#1 Personal Finance book of all time**... translated into dozens
    of languages and sold around the world.\r\n\r\nRich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's
    story of growing up with two dads \u2014 his real father and the father of his
    best friend, his rich dad \u2014 and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts
    about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a
    high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money
    and having your money work for you.\r\n\r\n20 Years... 20/20 Hindsight\r\nIn
    the 20th Anniversary Edition of this classic, Robert offers an update on what
    we\u2019ve seen over the past 20 years related to money, investing, and the global
    economy. Sidebars throughout the book will take readers \u201Cfast forward\u201D
    \u2014 from 1997 to today \u2014 as Robert assesses how the principles taught
    by his rich dad have stood the test of time.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the messages
    of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were criticized and challenged two decades
    ago, are more meaningful, relevant and important today than they were 20 years
    ago.\r\n\r\nAs always, readers can expect that Robert will be candid, insightful...
    and continue to rock more than a few boats in his retrospective.\r\n\r\nWill
    there be a few surprises? Count on it.\r\n\r\nRich Dad Poor Dad...\r\n\u2022
    Explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich\r\n\u2022
    Challenges the belief that your house is an asset\r\n\u2022 Shows parents why
    they can't rely on the school system to teach their kids\r\nabout money\r\n\u2022
    Defines once and for all an asset and a liability\r\n\u2022 Teaches you what
    to teach your kids about money for their future financial success."
