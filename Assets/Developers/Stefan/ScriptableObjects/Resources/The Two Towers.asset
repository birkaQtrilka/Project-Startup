  <Description>k__BackingField: "The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien's three-volume
    epic, is set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth -- home to many strange beings,
    and most notably hobbits, a peace-loving \"little people,\" cheerful and shy.
    Since its original British publication in 1954-55, the saga has entranced readers
    of all ages. It is at once a classic myth and a modern fairy tale. Critic Michael
    Straight has hailed it as one of the \"very few works of genius in recent literature.\"
    Middle-earth is a world receptive to poets, scholars, children, and all other
    people of good will. Donald Barr has described it as \"a scrubbed morning world,
    and a ringing nightmare world...especially sunlit, and shadowed by perils very
    fundamental, of a peculiarly uncompounded darkness.\" The story of this world
    is one of high and heroic adventure. Barr compared it to Beowulf, C.S. Lewis
    to Orlando Furioso, W.H. Auden to The Thirty-nine Steps. In fact the saga is
    sui generis -- a triumph of imagination which springs to life within its own
    framework and on its own terms. - Jacket flap.\r\n\r\nFrodo and the Companions
    of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling
    Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks
    of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in the battle with an evil spirit
    in the Mines of Moria; and at the Falls of Rauros, Boromir, seduced by the power
    of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape
    the rest of the company were attacked by Orcs. Now they continue their journey
    alone down the great River Anduin \u2013 alone, that is, save for the mysterious
    creeping figure that follows wherever they go. J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s great work
    of imaginative fiction has been labelled both a heroic romance and a classic
    fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative
    moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world
    which is totally convincing in its detail.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Also contained
