  <Description>k__BackingField: Critically acclaimed as one of the most successful
    economy books of all time, and a 'must-read' for those of us in the general public
    who want to understand how society works, but do not want this information to
    be conveyed in an Oxbridge multipolysyllabic tone, Tim Harford's book gives us
    an insight into the relevance of the economy to our everyday lives. It begins
    humbly with the author's relatable bemoaning of coffee and its prices, which
    is cleverly analogized in the simple, but brilliant and still-relevant ideas
    of nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo. Organized into clear chapters
    which target different aspects of the economy's impacts on our life, the book
    later progresses onto more developed concepts such as the reasons (sub-prime
    mortgages!) behind the banking collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Written in
    an aware style from an economist's perspective, this book is thoroughly worthwhile
    reading.
