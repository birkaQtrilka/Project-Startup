  <Description>k__BackingField: Their scorching, sensual affair ended in heartbreak
    and recrimination, but Christian Grey cannot get Anastasia Steele out of his
    mind, or his blood. Determined to win her back, he tries to suppress his darkest
    desires and his need for complete control, and to love Ana on her own terms.
    But the horrors of his childhood still haunt him, and Ana's scheming boss, Jack
    Hyde, clearly wants her for himself.  Can Christian's confidant and therapist,
    Dr. Flynn, help him face down his demons? Or will the possessiveness of Elena,
    his seducer, and the deranged devotion of Leila, his former submissive, drag
    Christian down into the past?
