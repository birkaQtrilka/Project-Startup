  <Description>k__BackingField: 'Few men could compare to Benjamin Franklin. Virtually
    self-taught, he excelled as an athlete, a man of letters, a printer, a scientist,
    a wit, an inventor, an editor, and a writer, and he was probably the most successful
    diplomat in American history. David Hume hailed him as the first great philosopher
    and great man of letters in the New World.



    Written initially to guide
    his son, Franklin''s autobiography is a lively, spellbinding account of his unique
    and eventful life. Stylistically his best work, it has become a classic in world
    literature, one to inspire and delight readers everywhere.'
