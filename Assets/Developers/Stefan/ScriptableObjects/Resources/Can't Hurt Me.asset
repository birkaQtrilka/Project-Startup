    For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare--poverty, prejudice,
    and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline,
    mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed,
    overweight young man with no future into a US Armed Forces icon and one of the
    world''s top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training
    as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force tactical air controller, he went on
    to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name
    him the Fittest (Real) Man in America.



    In Can''t Hurt Me, he shares his
    astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40 percent of
    our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates
    a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their
    full potential.



    An annotated edition of Can''t Hurt Me, offering over
    two hours of bonus content featuring deeper insights and never-before-told stories
    shared by David. Not available in other formats.'
