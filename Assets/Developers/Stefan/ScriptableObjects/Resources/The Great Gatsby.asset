  <Description>k__BackingField: "Here is a novel, glamorous, ironical, compassionate
    \u2013 a marvelous fusion into unity of the curious incongruities of the life
    of the period \u2013 which reveals a hero like no other \u2013 one who could
    live at no other time and in no other place. But he will live as a character,
    we surmise, as long as the memory of any reader lasts.\r\n\r\n\"There was something
    gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life.... It
    was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never
    found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.\"\r\n\r\nIt
    is the story of this Jay Gatsby who came so mysteriously to West Egg, of his
    sumptuous entertainments, and of his love for Daisy Buchanan \u2013 a story that
    ranges from pure lyrical beauty to sheer brutal realism, and is infused with
    a sense of the strangeness of human circumstance in a heedless universe.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a magical, living book, blended of irony, romance, and mysticism.\r\n\r\n--first
