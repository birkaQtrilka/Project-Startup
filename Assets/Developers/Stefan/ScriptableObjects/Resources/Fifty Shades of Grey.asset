    interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful,
    brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize
    she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate
    to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana\u2019s quiet beauty, wit, and independent
    spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too\u2014but on his own terms.\r\n \r\nShocked
    yet thrilled by Grey\u2019s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the
    trappings of success\u2014his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his
    loving family\u2014Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need
    to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair,
    Ana discovers Christian Grey\u2019s secrets and explores her own dark desires.\r\n\r\nErotic,
    amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess
    you, possess you, and stay with you forever.\r\n\r\nThis book is intended for
    mature audiences."
