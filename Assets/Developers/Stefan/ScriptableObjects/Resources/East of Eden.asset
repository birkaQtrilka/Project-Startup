  <Description>k__BackingField: "Steinbeck considered East of Eden to be his masterpiece.
    In his journal, Journal of a Novel (often read as a companion to the novel) he
    notes that \u201Cthis is the book I have always wanted and have worked and prayed
    to be able to write Set primarily in the Salinas Valley in the early twentieth
    century, the novel traces three generations of two families \u2013 the Trasks
    and the Hamiltons \u2013 as they grapple with the ever-present forces of good
    and evil. From this plot emerged some of Steinbeck\u2019s most fascinating characters
    \u2013 many of whom are modeled after people in his own life.\r\n\r\nPart allegory,
    part autobiography, and part epic, East of Eden was an ambitious project from
    the start \u2013 a gift to Steinbeck\u2019s sons that was meant to teach them
    about identity, grief, and what it means to be human. Tinged with biblical echoes
    of the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Abel, this sprawling
    saga has captivated audiences everywhere for generations. It is through the popularization
    of East of Eden that the Salinas Valley was truly transformed into \u201Cthe
    valley of the world\u201D; a place where everyone is able to find a piece of
    themselves in the golden, rolling hills.\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nContains:\r\n\r\n
