    <Description>k__BackingField: "A mysterious island. An abandoned orphanage. A
      strange collection of photographs.\nWhen sixteen-year-old Jacob Portman follows
      a trail of clues left by his grandfather, he stumbles upon the ruins of Miss
      Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children. But as he explores, he realizes
      the children who once lived there may have been more than just peculiar\u2014they
      may have been dangerous. And they might still be alive.\nBlending haunting
      vintage photography with an eerie, fantastical tale, Miss Peregrine\u2019s
      Home for Peculiar Children is a spine-tingling adventure filled with wonder,
      mystery, and a world unlike any other.\n"
