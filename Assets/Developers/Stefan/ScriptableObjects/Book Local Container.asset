    <Description>k__BackingField: "Originally published from 1954 through 1956, J.R.R.
      Tolkien's richly complex series ushered in a new age of epic adventure storytelling.
      A philologist and illustrator who took inspiration from his work, Tolkien invented
      the modern heroic quest novel from the ground up, creating not just a world,
      but a domain, not just a lexicon, but a language, that would spawn countless
      imitators and lead to the inception of the epic fantasy genre. Today, THE LORD
      OF THE RINGS is considered \"the most influential fantasy novel ever written.\"
      (THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FANTASY)\r\n\r\nDuring his travels across Middle-earth,
      the hobbit Bilbo Baggins had found the Ring. But the simple band of gold was
      far from ordinary; it was in fact the One Ring - the greatest of the ancient
      Rings of Power. Sauron, the Dark Lord, had infused it with his own evil magic,
      and when it was lost, he was forced to flee into hiding.\r\n\r\nBut now Sauron's
      exile has ended and his power is spreading anew, fueled by the knowledge that
      his treasure has been found. He has gathered all the Great Rings to him, and
      will stop at nothing to reclaim the One that will complete his dominion. The
      only way to stop him is to cast the Ruling Ring deep into the Fire-Mountain
      at the heart of the land of Mordor--Sauron's dark realm.\r\n\r\nFate has placed
      the burden in the hands of Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's heir...and he is resolved
      to bear it to its end. Or his own. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Contains**\r\n\r\n

      though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After
      many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit. In
      a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with
      an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care.
      Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to
      the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his
      evil purpose."

    <Description>k__BackingField: "The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien's three-volume
      epic, is set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth -- home to many strange
      beings, and most notably hobbits, a peace-loving \"little people,\" cheerful
      and shy. Since its original British publication in 1954-55, the saga has entranced
      readers of all ages. It is at once a classic myth and a modern fairy tale.
      Critic Michael Straight has hailed it as one of the \"very few works of genius
      in recent literature.\" Middle-earth is a world receptive to poets, scholars,
      children, and all other people of good will. Donald Barr has described it as
      \"a scrubbed morning world, and a ringing nightmare world...especially sunlit,
      and shadowed by perils very fundamental, of a peculiarly uncompounded darkness.\"
      The story of this world is one of high and heroic adventure. Barr compared
      it to Beowulf, C.S. Lewis to Orlando Furioso, W.H. Auden to The Thirty-nine
      Steps. In fact the saga is sui generis -- a triumph of imagination which springs
      to life within its own framework and on its own terms. - Jacket flap.\r\n\r\nFrodo
      and the Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest
      to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by
      destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in
      the battle with an evil spirit in the Mines of Moria; and at the Falls of Rauros,
      Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While
      Frodo and Sam made their escape the rest of the company were attacked by Orcs.
      Now they continue their journey alone down the great River Anduin \u2013 alone,
      that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they
      go. J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s great work of imaginative fiction has been labelled
      both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely,
      epic and diabolic, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and
      character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Also

    <Description>k__BackingField: Their scorching, sensual affair ended in heartbreak
      and recrimination, but Christian Grey cannot get Anastasia Steele out of his
      mind, or his blood. Determined to win her back, he tries to suppress his darkest
      desires and his need for complete control, and to love Ana on her own terms.
      But the horrors of his childhood still haunt him, and Ana's scheming boss,
      Jack Hyde, clearly wants her for himself.  Can Christian's confidant and therapist,
      Dr. Flynn, help him face down his demons? Or will the possessiveness of Elena,
      his seducer, and the deranged devotion of Leila, his former submissive, drag
      Christian down into the past?

      \u2013 a marvelous fusion into unity of the curious incongruities of the life
      of the period \u2013 which reveals a hero like no other \u2013 one who could
      live at no other time and in no other place. But he will live as a character,
      we surmise, as long as the memory of any reader lasts.\r\n\r\n\"There was something
      gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life....
      It was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have
      never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find
      again.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the story of this Jay Gatsby who came so mysteriously
      to West Egg, of his sumptuous entertainments, and of his love for Daisy Buchanan
      \u2013 a story that ranges from pure lyrical beauty to sheer brutal realism,
      and is infused with a sense of the strangeness of human circumstance in a heedless
      universe.\r\n\r\nIt is a magical, living book, blended of irony, romance, and

    <Description>k__BackingField: "The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare,
      believed to have been written in 1610\u201311, and thought by many critics
      to be the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone. It is set on a remote island,
      where Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda
      to her rightful place using illusion and skilful manipulation. He conjures
      up a storm, the eponymous tempest, to lure his usurping brother Antonio and
      the complicit King Alonso of Naples to the island. There, his machinations
      bring about the revelation of Antonio's lowly nature, the redemption of the
      King, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand."

    <Description>k__BackingField: "Originally published from 1954 through 1956, J.R.R.
      Tolkien's richly complex series ushered in a new age of epic adventure storytelling.
      A philologist and illustrator who took inspiration from his work, Tolkien invented
      the modern heroic quest novel from the ground up, creating not just a world,
      but a domain, not just a lexicon, but a language, that would spawn countless
      imitators and lead to the inception of the epic fantasy genre. Today, THE LORD
      OF THE RINGS is considered \"the most influential fantasy novel ever written.\"
      (THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FANTASY)\r\n\r\nDuring his travels across Middle-earth,
      the hobbit Bilbo Baggins had found the Ring. But the simple band of gold was
      far from ordinary; it was in fact the One Ring - the greatest of the ancient
      Rings of Power. Sauron, the Dark Lord, had infused it with his own evil magic,
      and when it was lost, he was forced to flee into hiding.\r\n\r\nBut now Sauron's
      exile has ended and his power is spreading anew, fueled by the knowledge that
      his treasure has been found. He has gathered all the Great Rings to him, and
      will stop at nothing to reclaim the One that will complete his dominion. The
      only way to stop him is to cast the Ruling Ring deep into the Fire-Mountain
      at the heart of the land of Mordor--Sauron's dark realm.\r\n\r\nFate has placed
      the burden in the hands of Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's heir...and he is resolved
      to bear it to its end. Or his own. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Contains**\r\n\r\n

      Over 4 million
      copies sold



      For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare--poverty,
      prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But
      through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed
      himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a US Armed
      Forces icon and one of the world''s top endurance athletes. The only man in
      history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force
      tactical air controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events,
      inspiring Outside magazine to name him the Fittest (Real) Man in America.



      In
      Can''t Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most
      of us tap into only 40 percent of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The
      40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past
      pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.



      An annotated
      edition of Can''t Hurt Me, offering over two hours of bonus content featuring
      deeper insights and never-before-told stories shared by David. Not available
      in other formats.'

    <Description>k__BackingField: 'Pride and Prejudice is an 1813 novel of manners
      written by Jane Austen. The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth
      Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions
      of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial
      goodness and actual goodness.



      Mr. Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate
      in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can
      only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family
      faces becoming very poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least
      one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that
      drives the plot.'

    <Description>k__BackingField: "April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the
      personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal
      Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad
      Poor Dad was first published, readers will find that very little in the book
      itself has changed \u2014 and for good reason. While so much in our world is
      changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad
      Poor Dad haven\u2019t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role
      in our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s international bestseller
      are more timely and more important than ever.\r\n\r\nMilestones \r\n\r\nWhile
      there is a milestone  to commemorate \u2014 and a new section in the book on
      Why Milestones Are Important \u2014 preserving the integrity of the original
      content is testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of
      time. The sidebars throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary
      edition) have been updated again, but the core principles that parents and
      grandparents \u2014 those who embraced Robert\u2019s story and messages 25
      years ago \u2014 are sharing them with new generations who have found that
      its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyone\u2019s
      life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances.\r\nPeople
      of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure
      time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons we\u2019ve learned, and celebrate
      accomplishments\u2026 and they give meaning to our life\u2019s journey. They
      are a way that we integrate past, present, and future\u2026 looking back at
      where we started, where we are today\u2026 and the promise of all that the
      future can hold."

    <Description>k__BackingField: "Steinbeck considered East of Eden to be his masterpiece.
      In his journal, Journal of a Novel (often read as a companion to the novel)
      he notes that \u201Cthis is the book I have always wanted and have worked and
      prayed to be able to write Set primarily in the Salinas Valley in the early
      twentieth century, the novel traces three generations of two families \u2013
      the Trasks and the Hamiltons \u2013 as they grapple with the ever-present forces
      of good and evil. From this plot emerged some of Steinbeck\u2019s most fascinating
      characters \u2013 many of whom are modeled after people in his own life.\r\n\r\nPart
      allegory, part autobiography, and part epic, East of Eden was an ambitious
      project from the start \u2013 a gift to Steinbeck\u2019s sons that was meant
      to teach them about identity, grief, and what it means to be human. Tinged
      with biblical echoes of the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and
      Abel, this sprawling saga has captivated audiences everywhere for generations.
      It is through the popularization of East of Eden that the Salinas Valley was
      truly transformed into \u201Cthe valley of the world\u201D; a place where everyone
      is able to find a piece of themselves in the golden, rolling hills.\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nContains:\r\n\r\n

    <Description>k__BackingField: Critically acclaimed as one of the most successful
      economy books of all time, and a 'must-read' for those of us in the general
      public who want to understand how society works, but do not want this information
      to be conveyed in an Oxbridge multipolysyllabic tone, Tim Harford's book gives
      us an insight into the relevance of the economy to our everyday lives. It begins
      humbly with the author's relatable bemoaning of coffee and its prices, which
      is cleverly analogized in the simple, but brilliant and still-relevant ideas
      of nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo. Organized into clear chapters
      which target different aspects of the economy's impacts on our life, the book
      later progresses onto more developed concepts such as the reasons (sub-prime
      mortgages!) behind the banking collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Written
      in an aware style from an economist's perspective, this book is thoroughly
      worthwhile reading.

    <Description>k__BackingField: "It's been nearly 25 years since Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s
      Rich Dad Poor Dad first made waves in the Personal Finance arena.\r\nIt has
      since become the **#1 Personal Finance book of all time**... translated into
      dozens of languages and sold around the world.\r\n\r\nRich Dad Poor Dad is
      Robert's story of growing up with two dads \u2014 his real father and the father
      of his best friend, his rich dad \u2014 and the ways in which both men shaped
      his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you
      need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working
      for money and having your money work for you.\r\n\r\n20 Years... 20/20 Hindsight\r\nIn
      the 20th Anniversary Edition of this classic, Robert offers an update on what
      we\u2019ve seen over the past 20 years related to money, investing, and the
      global economy. Sidebars throughout the book will take readers \u201Cfast forward\u201D
      \u2014 from 1997 to today \u2014 as Robert assesses how the principles taught
      by his rich dad have stood the test of time.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the messages
      of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were criticized and challenged two decades
      ago, are more meaningful, relevant and important today than they were 20 years
      ago.\r\n\r\nAs always, readers can expect that Robert will be candid, insightful...
      and continue to rock more than a few boats in his retrospective.\r\n\r\nWill
      there be a few surprises? Count on it.\r\n\r\nRich Dad Poor Dad...\r\n\u2022
      Explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich\r\n\u2022
      Challenges the belief that your house is an asset\r\n\u2022 Shows parents why

    <Description>k__BackingField: 'Few men could compare to Benjamin Franklin. Virtually
      self-taught, he excelled as an athlete, a man of letters, a printer, a scientist,
      a wit, an inventor, an editor, and a writer, and he was probably the most successful
      diplomat in American history. David Hume hailed him as the first great philosopher
      and great man of letters in the New World.



      Written initially to guide
      his son, Franklin''s autobiography is a lively, spellbinding account of his
      unique and eventful life. Stylistically his best work, it has become a classic
      in world literature, one to inspire and delight readers everywhere.'
